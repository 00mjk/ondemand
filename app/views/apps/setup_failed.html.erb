<h2>A problem occurred while initializing your data for this app.</h2>

<p class="lead">
At your own risk you can still <a href="<%= @app_url %>">open the app</a> 
or you can just go <a href="<%= root_path %>">back to the dashboard</a>
</p>

<p>Share this with the developer of your app:
The setup production script is supposed to be idempotent and is run each time 
the user opens the app through the dashboard.</p>

<h4>Stack trace:</h4>
