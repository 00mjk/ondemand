# OOD Active Jobs

[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/OSC%2Food-activejobs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/OSC%2Food-activejobs)

Application displays the current system status of jobs running, queued, and held on the Oakley and Ruby Clusters.

## New Install

**Installation assumptions: you have an Open OnDemand installation with File
Explorer and Shell apps installed and a cluster config added to
/etc/ood/config/clusters.d directory.**

1. Start in the **build directory** for all sys apps, clone and check out the
   latest version of the activejobs app (make sure the app directory's name is
   `activejobs`):

   ```sh
   scl enable git19 -- git clone https://github.com/OSC/ood-activejobs.git activejobs
   cd activejobs
   scl enable git19 -- git checkout tags/v1.4.3
   ```

2. Install the app for a production environment:

   ```sh
   RAILS_ENV=production scl enable git19 rh-ruby22 nodejs010 -- bin/setup
   ```

   this will setup a default Open OnDemand install. If you'd like a specific
   pre-defined portal such as OSC OnDemand you'd specify `OOD_SITE` and
   `OOD_PORTAL` as:

   ```sh
   OOD_SITE=osc OOD_PORTAL=ondemand RAILS_ENV=production scl enable git19 rh-ruby22 nodejs010 -- bin/setup
   ```

3. Copy the built app directory to the deployment directory, and start the
   server. i.e.:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/ood/apps/sys/activejobs
   sudo cp -r . /var/www/ood/apps/sys/activejobs
   ```

## Updating to a New Stable Version

1. Navigate to the app's build directory and check out the latest version:

   ```sh
   cd activejobs # cd to build directory
   scl enable git19 -- git fetch
   scl enable git19 -- git checkout tags/v1.4.3
   ```

2. Update the app for a production environment:

   ```sh
   RAILS_ENV=production scl enable git19 rh-ruby22 nodejs010 -- bin/setup
   ```

   You do not need to specify `OOD_SITE` and `OOD_PORTAL` if they are defined
   in the `.env.local` file.

3. Copy the built app directory to the deployment directory:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/ood/apps/sys/activejobs
   sudo rsync -rlptv --delete . /var/www/ood/apps/sys/activejobs
   ```

## Usage

- Active Jobs displays in a datatables table formatted output of qstat that is searchable.
- The app displays a list of filters, one for each tab. Each filter has a title (Your Jobs, All Jobs, etc.) and is applied server side to the results of qstat.
- The data is retrieved via an Ajax request but to get updated data you must refresh the page.
- Progressive disclosure is used to show details of a job. Click on the "right arrow" handle to the left of a table row to show details.

## Configuration

### Custom Filters

More filters can be added (showing more tabs to the user of the app) by
inserting filters into the filter list in an initializer.
`config/initializers/filter.rb` has been added to `.gitignore` so this can be
safely added. An example of a custom filter can be viewed at
`config/initializers/filter.rb.osc`:

```ruby
Filter.list.insert(1, Filter.new.tap { |f|
  group = OodSupport::User.new.group.name
  f.title = "Your Group's Jobs (#{group})"
  f.filter_id = "group"
  f.filter_block = Proc.new { |id, attr| attr[:egroup] == group }
})
```

### Other Configuration

This application depends on a valid `ood_cluster` configuration. Please see the [ood_cluster](https://github.com/OSC/ood_cluster/blob/master/README.md) README for further details.

This application relies upon the `ood_appkit` dependency for certain branding defaults. You may override these defaults by creating an `.env.local` file in the root folder of this app and adding the variables there. See the documentation at [ood_appkit](https://github.com/OSC/ood_appkit) for further details.
