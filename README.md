# OOD Dashboard

[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/OSC%2Food-dashboard.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/OSC%2Food-dashboard)

This app is a Rails app for Open OnDemand that serves as a gateway to launching
other Open OnDemand apps. It is meant to be run as the user (and on behalf of
the user) using the app. Thus, at an HPC center if I log into OnDemand using
the `efranz` account, this app should run as `efranz`. This Rails app doesn't
use a database.

## New Install


1. Start in the **build directory** for all sys apps, clone and check out the
   latest version of the dashboard app (make sure the app directory's name is
   `dashboard`):

   ```sh
   scl enable git19 -- git clone https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard.git dashboard
   cd dashboard
   scl enable git19 -- git checkout tags/v1.10.1
   ```

2. Install the app for a production environment:

   ```sh
   RAILS_ENV=production scl enable git19 rh-ruby22 nodejs010 -- bin/setup
   ```

   this will setup a default Open OnDemand install. If you'd like a specific
   pre-defined portal such as OSC OnDemand you'd specify `OOD_SITE` and
   `OOD_PORTAL` as:

   ```sh
   OOD_SITE=osc OOD_PORTAL=ondemand RAILS_ENV=production scl enable git19 rh-ruby22 nodejs010 -- bin/setup
   ```

   assuming the corresponding `.env.local.$OOD_SITE.$OOD_PORTAL` file exists.

3. Copy the built app directory to the deployment directory, and start the
   server. i.e.:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/ood/apps/sys/dashboard
   sudo cp -r . /var/www/ood/apps/sys/dashboard
   ```

## Updating to a New Stable Version

1. Navigate to the app's build directory and check out the latest version:

   ```sh
   cd dashboard # cd to build directory
   scl enable git19 -- git fetch
   scl enable git19 -- git checkout tags/v1.10.1
   ```

2. Update the app for a production environment:

   ```sh
   RAILS_ENV=production scl enable git19 rh-ruby22 nodejs010 -- bin/setup
   ```

   You do not need to specify `OOD_SITE` and `OOD_PORTAL` if they are defined
   in the `.env.local` file.

3. Copy the built app directory to the deployment directory:

   ```sh
   sudo rsync -rlptv --delete . /var/www/ood/apps/sys/dashboard
   ```
