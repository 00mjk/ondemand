# Open OnDemand Ruby wrapper script
#
# The purpose of this script is to wrap up the necessary environment for the
# per-user NGINX (PUN) processes to run under. The PUN requires the following
# software in its environment:
#
# - nginx 1.6
# - passenger 4.0
# - ruby 2.2
# - node.js 0.10
#

# If the necessary libraries and PATH environment variable are loaded by
# default in a sudo environment, then no modifications are necessary to this
# file.

# If using RHEL 6 with Software Collections 2.0 please uncomment the following
# block of lines:
#source /opt/rh/nginx16/enable
#source /opt/rh/rh-passenger40/enable
#source /opt/rh/rh-ruby22/enable
#source /opt/rh/nodejs010/enable
#source /opt/rh/v8314/enable
