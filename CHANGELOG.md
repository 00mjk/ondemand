## Unreleased

  - refactored Configuration module to reduce duplication

Features:

  - move config file parsing from binary to library
  - separated paths where pun and app configs are stored for easier config
    cleanup
  - directly spawn Rails apps to keep all apps under parent process
  - removed unix group whitelists as this should be responsibility of apps and
    file permissions (provides greater flexibility)
  - set Nginx tmp root to user's home directory to allow for larger file
    uploads
  - introduced/renamed possible app environments to: `dev`, `usr`, and `sys`

Bugfixes:

  - `rake install` doesn't depend on `git` anymore

## 0.0.4 (2016-04-04)

  - use "restart" (stop + start) instead of "reload" after generating app
    config (takes advantage of `Open3` for executing nginx binary)

    behavior with older versions)
